## Project Description

The project aims to develop a robotic car utilizing a camera to detect human faces, calculate
their position, and autonomously navigate towards them, stopping precisely at their feet with the
aid of an ultrasonic sensor. The Beagle Bone will communicate with a Python server for image
analysis in order to accurately identify the target in the image.

### Accomplishments:
 - The robotic car is capable of detecting humans in images.
 - It can autonomously rotate to search for humans.
 - Equipped with a camera, the robotic car captures the current scene and transmits images to the server.
 - The Python server (TCP) receives images from the robotic car, detects humans, and returns the distance between them and the center of the picture if present.
 - Ultrasound is able to measure the distance between human and the robotic car in cm
 - Robotic car can be manually turned off by using joystick
 - Buzzer plays an audio cue whenever it transmits an TCP message to the server
 - 14-Seg display was able to accurately acquire how many pictures have been taken and display it

## General Server File Sturcture (Code)

- `ai_server/`: Contains all AI and TCP Server code
- `hal/`: Contains all low-level hardware abstraction layer (HAL) modules
- `app/`: Contains all application-specific code. Broken into modules and a main file
- `build/`: Generated by CMake; stores all temporary build files (may be deleted to clean)

## Usage

### Setup for Visual Studio Code
- Install CMake: `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt install cmake`
- When you first open the project, click the "Build" button in the status bar for CMake to generate the `build\` folder and recreate the makefiles.
  - When you edit and save a CMakeLists.txt file, VS Code will automatically update this folder.
- When you add a new file (.h or .c) to the project, you'll need to rerun CMake's build
  (Either click "Build" or resave `/CMakeLists.txt` to trigger VS Code re-running CMake)
- Cross-compile using VS Code's CMake addon:
  - The "kit" defines which compilers and tools will be run.
  - Change the kit via the menu: Help > Show All Commands, type "CMake: Select a kit".
    - Kit "GCC 10.2.1 arm-linux-gnueabi" builds for target.
    - Kit "Unspecified" builds for host (using default `gcc`).
  - Most CMake options for the project can be found in VS Code's CMake view (very left-hand side).
- Build the project using Ctrl+Shift+B, or by the menu: Terminal > Run Build Task...
  - If you try to build but get an error about "build is not a directory", the re-run CMake's build as mentioned above.
 
### Setup for Python Server
 #### Step 1: Setup AWS Rekognition
 
  - Register an AWS account (select region: ‘us-east-1’, or choose your region)
  - Setup IAM Policy:
    - Open AWS Console
    - In “IAM”, select “Users” (left side panel)
    - Click on “Create User” to create new user
    - Provide name for “User”
    - You might need to grant “programmatic access” - follow the link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/sdk-programmatic-access.html#programmatic-access-general	
    - In the “Permission Options”, for simplicity, select “Attach policies directly”
    - In “Attach policies directly” select “AmazonRekognitionFullAccess”, then create
  - Setup Access key:
    - Open the “User” is created in the above section
    - Click on “Create access key”
    - Under “Access key best practices & alternatives”, select “Application running outside AWS”
    - Click “Create access key” to complete the process
    - Save the “Access key” and “Secret access key” - later use to access AWS Rekognition

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies on Host (Linux - debian 11)
  - Install python and pip on host machine using below command
```
(host) ~$ sudo apt update
(host) ~$ sudo apt install python3
(host) ~$ sudo apt install python3-pip
```
  - Install boto3 package
```
(host) ~$ sudo pip3 install boto3
```

#### Step 3: Setup Python Server - TCP Protocol

 - Libraries requires: “boto3”, “os”
 - Use “os” library to get environment variable at run-time
 - Provide “Access key” and “Secret Key” at run-time (AWS & Git does not allow you to expose these information publicly)
```
Example:
AWS_Access_key:fake_access_key AWS_Secret_Key:fake_secret_key python3 humandetection.py
``` 

 - In server code, include this snippet to run AWS Rekognition:
```
AWS_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ID')
AWS_ACCESS = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS')
client = boto3.client('rekognition', 
        aws_access_key_id=AWS_ACCESS_KEY,
        aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS,
        region_name='us-east-1')
``` 
 
## Manually Running CMake

To manually run CMake from the command line use:

```shell
  # Regenerate build/ folder and makefiles:
  rm -rf build/         # Wipes temporary build folder
  cmake -S . -B build   # Generate makefiles in build\

  # Build (compile & link) the project
  cmake --build build
```
